# Chicago Institute of Art Virtual Museum

This was the final project that me, @sabinbajra, @DanW12 delivered at the end of a two-week sprint as the capstone of the challenging SALT Bootcamp. We are proud of what we were able to achieve in this short period of time. It was fun, to boot.

## Walkthrough
Below is a video detailing how the app looked while live:

As you can see, you can ‘wander’ through a digital Chicago Institute of Art, although naturally a more abbreviated version. The wings are semi-randomised, allowing one to rarely see the same art twice and creating the illusion of space and capacity.

## Tech stack
We made use of
- Java
- Typescript
- Next.JS/React
- Spring
- Material UI

We also made use of the Chicago Institute of Art api, which said institute has generously provided to the public.

## Any more to-dos?

The bootcamp, and our time at SALT, has come to an end and while there was some initial consideration of picking things up after the bootcamp came to a close, we have all gone different routes.
